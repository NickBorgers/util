# Util

A collection of portable, self-contained utilities designed to persist across job changes and environment setups. Built with a Docker-first approach for zero local dependencies and maximum portability.

## Philosophy

- **Containerized Everything**: Every utility runs in an isolated Docker container
- **Zero Local Dependencies**: No need to install ffmpeg, imagemagick, rclone, or other tools locally
- **Platform Independence**: Works identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows wherever Docker runs
- **Security by Isolation**: Older utilities use `--network=none` for security

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed and accessible as `docker`

### Installation

**For Shell Utilities** (media conversion, helper functions):
```bash
# Option 1: Clone and append to your shell profile
cat profile >> ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc

# Option 2: Just copy-paste the profile contents
# Open the profile file and paste into your shell config
```

**For Network Mapper** (recommended method):
```bash
# macOS
brew install nickborgers/tap/network-mapper

# Windows
choco install network-mapper

# Docker (any platform)
docker run ghcr.io/nickborgers/network-mapper:latest

# Or download binaries from GitHub Releases
```

## Utilities

### üåê Network Mapper (Primary Utility)
**Location**: [`network-mapper/`](network-mapper/) | **Full Docs**: [`network-mapper/README.md`](network-mapper/README.md)

A professional Go-based network discovery tool that helps you understand your home network environment.

**Features**:
- Automatic subnet and gateway detection
- Device identification and fingerprinting
- Service discovery (mDNS/Bonjour, SSDP/UPnP)
- MAC vendor identification
- Beautiful CLI visualization
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)

**Installation**: See Quick Start above for Homebrew, Chocolatey, or Docker installation.

### üé¨ Media Conversion Tools (Shell Functions)

After adding the `profile` to your shell config, these commands become available:

- **`heic_to_jpeg <file>`** - Convert Apple HEIC photos to JPEG for compatibility
- **`mov_to_gif <file>`** - Convert .mov videos to animated GIFs for documentation
- **`reduce_framerate <file>`** - Reduce video file size by lowering framerate to 15fps (great for screen recordings)
- **`stabilize_video <file> [zoom%]`** - Stabilize shaky videos using ffmpeg vidstab
- **`update_pdf <file>`** - Upgrade PDF files to version 1.4 for compatibility

---

### üì¶ Backup Services (Container-Based)

- **`onedrive-backup`** - Continuous OneDrive backup to local storage using rclone (hourly with one-year retention)
- **`backup-photos-to-gdrive`** - Continuous local photos backup to Google Drive with retry logic and validation

See individual directories for Docker Compose configuration and setup details.

---

### üîß Helper Functions (Shell Functions)

- **`get_docker_pids`** - Map Docker container IDs/names to host PIDs and UIDs for troubleshooting
- **`network_blip`** - Log network diagnostics to `/tmp/network_blips.log` for debugging connectivity issues
- **`unrar <file>`** - Extract RAR archives using Docker

## Why Docker for Everything?

**Portability**: Tools like ffmpeg, imagemagick, and rclone work identically across all platforms without version conflicts or missing dependencies.

**Security**: Simple utilities run with `--network=none`, preventing any possibility of data exfiltration even if images were compromised.

**Zero Maintenance**: No need to manage tool installations or updates on your local machine. Just pull updated containers.

**Isolation**: Each utility runs in its own environment without affecting your system or other tools.

## Security

**For Shell Utilities**: Docker images are built from this repository via [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/publish.yml) and published to Docker Hub. The GitHub account is protected with FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware keys, and Docker Hub credentials are stored only in GitHub Secrets and offline password database.

**Network Isolation**: Simple utilities use `--network=none` flag, making data exfiltration impossible even if images were compromised.

**For Network Mapper**: See [`network-mapper/BUILD_TRANSPARENCY.md`](network-mapper/BUILD_TRANSPARENCY.md) for information on build process, code signing, and addressing antivirus false positives.
