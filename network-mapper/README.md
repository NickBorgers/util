## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
./network-mapper
```

### Scan Modes & Intelligent Discovery

Network-mapper uses sophisticated subnet discovery to find devices beyond your immediate network. The tool supports multiple scan modes:

```bash
# Intelligent scan (default) - smart subnet discovery
./network-mapper --scan-mode intelligent --thoroughness 3

# Quick scan - interface subnets only
./network-mapper --scan-mode quick

# Brute force scans - comprehensive but slower
./network-mapper --scan-mode brute-expanded      # Common private ranges
./network-mapper --scan-mode brute-comprehensive # Full RFC1918 ranges
./network-mapper --scan-mode brute-firewall      # Security testing ranges
```

#### Scan Mode Details

- **`intelligent`** (default): 4-phase intelligent subnet discovery using network heuristics
- **`quick`**: Only scans interface subnets - fastest option
- **`brute-expanded`**: Scans common private network ranges systematically
- **`brute-comprehensive`**: Exhaustive scan of all RFC1918 private ranges
- **`brute-firewall`**: Security-focused scan targeting common network segments

#### Thoroughness Levels (Intelligent Mode Only)

Control the breadth of intelligent discovery with `--thoroughness 1-5`:

```bash
# Minimal discovery - only most common subnets
./network-mapper --thoroughness 1

# Light discovery - few common ranges
./network-mapper --thoroughness 2

# Default discovery - balanced approach
./network-mapper --thoroughness 3

# Thorough discovery - extensive subnet candidates
./network-mapper --thoroughness 4

# Exhaustive discovery - maximum subnet coverage
./network-mapper --thoroughness 5
```

**Thoroughness Level Details:**
- **Level 1**: Tests `.0.0` and `.1.0` subnets only (2-3 candidates)
- **Level 2**: Adds `.10.0` and `.100.0` subnets (4-6 candidates)
- **Level 3**: Common admin subnets: `.0`, `.1`, `.10`, `.20`, `.30`, `.50`, `.100`, `.168`, `.254` (9-12 candidates)
- **Level 4**: Extended ranges including `.2`, `.5`, `.11`, `.15`, `.25`, `.40`, etc. (20-30 candidates)
- **Level 5**: Every 10th subnet + all level 4 ranges (40-60 candidates)

### Intelligent Discovery Process

When you see "üîç Probing 19 subnet candidates for activity...", here's what's happening:

#### Phase 1: Interface Subnets (Priority 100)
- Adds all network interface subnets as high-priority candidates
- For large subnets (>/24), creates targeted /24 around interface IP
- Example: Interface on `192.168.1.5/24` ‚Üí candidate `192.168.1.0/24`

#### Phase 2: Adjacent Subnets (Priority 80)
- Generates numerically adjacent subnets to interface networks
- For `/24` networks: checks previous/next third octet
- Example: From `192.168.1.0/24` ‚Üí tests `192.168.0.0/24` and `192.168.2.0/24`

#### Phase 3: Common Subnet Patterns (Priority 60)
- Creates candidates based on common network administration patterns
- Uses thoroughness level to determine which third octets to test
- Example: In `192.168.x.0/24` range, tests common `x` values like `0`, `1`, `10`, `50`, `100`, `254`

#### Phase 4: Gateway Probing
- Tests common gateway IPs in each candidate subnet: `.1`, `.254`, `.10`, `.100`, `.50`
- Uses ICMP ping to verify gateway accessibility
- Marks subnets as active when gateway responds
- Example output: `‚úÖ Found active gateway 192.168.254.1 in subnet 192.168.254.0/24`

### Route Table Integration

Network-mapper consults your system's routing table to accurately determine which interface should handle discovered subnets:

- **Linux**: Uses `ip route show` command
- **macOS**: Uses `netstat -rn -f inet` command
- **Windows**: Uses `route print` command

Discovered subnets are displayed with the correct interface based on actual routing rules, not just heuristics.

### Practical Examples & Usage Scenarios

#### Home Network Security Audit
```bash
# Quick overview of your immediate network
./network-mapper --scan-mode quick

# Thorough discovery of all network segments
./network-mapper --scan-mode intelligent --thoroughness 4 --verbose

# Example output when multiple VLANs are discovered:
üîç Probing 19 subnet candidates for activity...
‚úÖ Found active gateway 192.168.1.1 in subnet 192.168.1.0/24      # Main network
‚úÖ Found active gateway 192.168.10.1 in subnet 192.168.10.0/24   # IoT VLAN
‚úÖ Found active gateway 192.168.50.1 in subnet 192.168.50.0/24   # Guest network
‚úÖ Found active gateway 10.10.0.1 in subnet 10.10.0.0/24         # Work VLAN
‚úÖ Found active gateway 172.16.0.1 in subnet 172.16.0.0/24       # Admin network
```

#### Enterprise Network Discovery
```bash
# Conservative scan for large corporate networks
./network-mapper --scan-mode intelligent --thoroughness 2

# Security assessment with firewall testing
./network-mapper --scan-mode brute-firewall --verbose
```

#### Troubleshooting Network Issues
```bash
# Fast scan to identify connectivity issues
./network-mapper --scan-mode quick --no-services

# Detailed scan with verbose output for debugging
./network-mapper --verbose --timeout 10
```

#### Understanding Your Network Topology
When network-mapper finds multiple subnets, it means:

- **üè† Home Networks**: You likely have VLANs for IoT devices, guest access, or network segmentation
- **üè¢ Corporate**: Different departments, security zones, or VLAN configurations
- **üîç Security**: Previously unknown network segments that need investigation

**Common subnet patterns discovered:**
- `.0.0/24` - Main/default network
- `.1.0/24` - Management network
- `.10.0/24` - IoT/smart home devices
- `.50.0/24` - Guest network
- `.100.0/24` - Work/office network
- `.254.0/24` - Administrative/infrastructure

### Other Options

```bash
# Fast scanning without DNS lookups or service discovery
./network-mapper --no-dns --no-services --scan-mode quick

# Custom timeout for slower networks
./network-mapper --timeout 10 --scan-mode intelligent
```

The tool will automatically:
1. Discover all network interfaces on your system
2. Expand scan ranges based on RFC1918 networks and selected scan mode
3. Scan for active devices across the determined ranges
4. Identify device types and services
5. Display a beautiful network topology map

## Device Types & Service Discovery

The tool can identify various device types using multiple detection methods:

### Traditional Port-Based Detection
- **Windows PC**: Devices with RDP (3389) and SMB (135/139) ports
- **Linux Server**: Devices with SSH (22) and HTTP/HTTPS (80/443) ports
- **Linux/Unix**: Devices with SSH (22) port only
- **Web Server**: Devices with HTTP/HTTPS ports only
- **File Server**: Devices with SMB ports
- **Network Printer**: Devices with IPP (631) or raw printing (9100) ports
- **Router/Gateway**: Devices with DNS (53) and DHCP (67) services

### Enhanced Service-Based Detection
- **Apple TV/AirPlay**: Detected via mDNS AirPlay services and Apple vendor MAC
- **Chromecast/Google Device**: Identified through Google Cast mDNS services
- **HomeKit Device**: Found via HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP) services
- **Media Server**: Detected through DLNA/UPnP media server announcements
- **Apple Device**: Identified via Apple services (DAAP, Time Machine, etc.) and MAC vendor
- **Raspberry Pi**: Detected through Raspberry Pi Foundation MAC addresses
- **Smart Home Devices**: IoT devices found via various mDNS service types

### Service Discovery Protocols Used
- **mDNS/Bonjour**: Discovers Apple ecosystem services, IoT devices, printers
- **SSDP/UPnP**: Finds media devices, routers, smart TVs, NAS devices
- **DHCP Lease Tables**: Extracts hostnames and MAC addresses from network infrastructure
- **IEEE OUI Database**: Identifies device manufacturers from MAC addresses
- **Multicast Monitoring**: Detects devices participating in multicast groups

## Build Transparency & Antivirus Compatibility

Network-mapper is built with **complete transparency** to help users understand exactly how the binary works and to minimize antivirus false positives.

### Key Transparency Features

- **üîç Full debug symbols**: Windows binaries preserve all debugging information for complete transparency
- **üìñ Open source**: Every network operation is visible in the source code
- **üõ†Ô∏è Standard libraries**: Uses Go's standard `net` package in documented, legitimate ways
- **üö´ Zero obfuscation**: No packing, compression, or symbol stripping that looks suspicious

### Windows Defender Compatibility

Our Windows builds specifically avoid the `-s -w` build flags that are known triggers for `Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B!ml` false positives. This approach:

- Preserves full debug information for security analysis
- Makes network operations completely transparent to ML algorithms
- Allows developers to step through and verify network discovery logic

For detailed debugging instructions and transparency documentation, see [`BUILD_TRANSPARENCY.md`](BUILD_TRANSPARENCY.md).

## Security Considerations & Firewall Testing

### Safe Scanning Practices
- The tool uses non-intrusive scanning methods
- Only scans common ports (22, 80, 443, etc.)
- Uses standard network tools available on the system
- Respects network timeouts to avoid being too aggressive
- Only scans RFC1918 private address spaces

### Firewall Configuration Testing

The `--scan-mode firewall-test` option is specifically designed for network security testing:

```bash
# Test your firewall configuration across network segments
./network-mapper --scan-mode firewall-test --verbose
```

This mode helps identify:
- **Network segmentation gaps**: Devices accessible across supposed network boundaries
- **Firewall rule effectiveness**: Whether inter-VLAN blocking is working properly
- **Hidden network ranges**: Additional subnets that may not be immediately visible
- **Security policy compliance**: Verification that network isolation is functioning

### Example Use Cases

1. **Home Network Security**: If your home network is `192.168.1.0/24` but your WiFi guest network is `192.168.50.0/24`, firewall-test mode will scan both ranges to verify isolation.

2. **Corporate Network Audit**: Test whether development networks can access production subnets, or if guest WiFi is properly segmented.

3. **Network Discovery**: Find additional network ranges that may not be obvious from your current interface configuration.

### RFC1918 Network Expansion

The tool intelligently expands scan ranges based on detected RFC1918 networks:

- **10.x.x.x networks**: Expands to /16 and /12 ranges as appropriate
- **172.16-31.x.x networks**: Expands to /20 and broader ranges
- **192.168.x.x networks**: Scans adjacent /24 networks

This expansion only occurs within RFC1918 private address spaces for safety.
